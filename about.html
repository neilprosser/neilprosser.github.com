<p>My name is Neil Prosser and I live in a marvellous little city called Bristol in the UK.</p>
<p>I work with the JVM in Clojure or Java. I work for <a href="http://englishlanguageitutoring.com">ELiT</a>. In my previous life I've worked for <a href="https://screentimelabs.com">Screen Time Labs</a> and MixRadio/Microsoft/Nokia Music where I was responsible for their deployment tooling (if you're really interested you can see <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/6057-herding-cattle-with-clojure-at-mixradio">a video of me talking about that at Clojure eXchange 2014</a>). Before that, in the very distant past, I was a .NET developer at <a href="http://www.trueclarity.co.uk">True Clarity</a>.</p>
