<p>My name is Neil Prosser and I live in a marvellous little city called Bristol in the UK.</p>
<p>I'm paid by Nokia Entertainment to code Java but along with fellow dissenters I spend as much time as possible monkeying around with whatever shiny things I can get my hands on. In my previous life I was a .NET developer and I've been known to dabble in HTML too (as if that wasn't obvious from this beautiful site).</p>
